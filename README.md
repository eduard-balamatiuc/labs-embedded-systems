# Embedded Systems Laboratory Projects

This repository contains laboratory work exercises from the "Embedded Systems" course at the Technical University of Moldova.

## Labs Overview

- **[Laboratory 1.1](./laboratory_1_1)**: Basic LED Control via Serial - Simple Arduino project for controlling an LED through serial commands.

- **[Laboratory 1.2](./laboratory_1_2)**: Keypad Security System - Implementation of a security code entry system with keypad, LCD display, and LED indicators.

- **[Laboratory 2.1](./laboratory_2_1)**: Sequential Task System - Implementation of a simple task scheduler without using RTOS, demonstrating sequential task execution with precise timing.

- **[Laboratory 2.2](./laboratory_2_2)**: FreeRTOS Modular Embedded Application - Demonstration of FreeRTOS tasks, semaphores, mutexes, and queues for real-time operations.

- **[Laboratory 3.1](./laboratory_3_1)**: Sensor Data Acquisition with FreeRTOS - Ultrasonic distance sensor system using FreeRTOS with display on LCD and serial monitor.

- **[Laboratory 3.2](./laboratory_3_2)**: Ultrasonic Distance Sensor with Advanced Filtering - ESP32-based application implementing median and moving average filtering for ultrasonic sensor measurements.

- **[Laboratory 4.1](./laboratory_4_1)**: Relay Control System - Serial command-controlled relay system for switching external devices.

- **[Laboratory 4.2](./laboratory_4_2)**: DC Motor Control System - Implementation of a command-line controlled DC motor with precise speed and direction control.

## Common Technologies

The laboratory projects use the following technologies:
- Arduino Uno and ESP32 microcontrollers
- PlatformIO and Arduino IDE development environments
- FreeRTOS real-time operating system
- Various sensors (ultrasonic, keypad)
- Output devices (LCD, LEDs, motors, relays)
- Serial communication for debugging and control

## Building and Running

Each laboratory folder contains its own README with specific instructions for building and running the projects.
